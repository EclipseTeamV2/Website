                    <h2>What is the best programming language to learn first?</h2>
                    <p>It depends on your goals. Python is often recommended for beginners due to its readability and broad usage. JavaScript is essential for web development, while languages like Java or C++ are useful for understanding fundamental programming concepts.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>How can I start learning to code?</h2>
                    <p>Start with online tutorials and courses, such as Codecademy, freeCodeCamp, or Coursera. Practice coding regularly, work on small projects, and consider joining coding communities for support and feedback.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>What are the differences between front-end and back-end development?</h2>
                    <p>Front-end development focuses on the user interface and experience (e.g., HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Back-end development involves server-side programming and database management (e.g., Node.js, Python, Ruby on Rails).</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>What is version control, and why is it important?</h2>
                    <p>Version control systems like Git track changes to your codebase over time, allowing you to manage and collaborate on code more efficiently. It helps in maintaining code history, reverting changes, and collaborating with others.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>What are some common coding best practices?</h2>
                    <p>Write clean, readable code; use meaningful variable and function names; comment on your code; follow a consistent coding style; and test your code thoroughly.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>How do I debug my code?</h2>
                    <p>Use debugging tools provided by your development environment or IDE, add print statements or logging to track variable values and program flow, and review error messages carefully to identify issues.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>What is an API, and how do I use it?</h2>
                    <p>An API (Application Programming Interface) allows different software systems to communicate with each other. You use APIs by making requests to their endpoints and handling the responses in your code.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>What are libraries and frameworks in programming?</h2>
                    <p>Libraries are collections of pre-written code that you can use to perform common tasks, while frameworks provide a structured foundation for developing applications and often include libraries, tools, and conventions.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>How do I choose the right framework for my project?</h2>
                    <p>Consider the project's requirements, the framework's learning curve, community support, performance, and how well it integrates with other tools and technologies you plan to use.</p>
                </div>
                <div class="faq-item">
                    <h2>What is a code repository, and how do I use one?</h2>
                    <p>A code repository (like GitHub or GitLab) stores and manages your codebase. You use it to host your code, collaborate with others, track changes, and maintain versions of your project.</p>
